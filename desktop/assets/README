The following files were copied (without permission) from the LibGDX
project from the "extensions/gdx-tools/assets" folder:

	default.fnt
	default.png
	uiskin.atlas
	uiskin.json
	uiskin.png

They are used in the LibGDX examples for how to use Skins, Buttons,
TextFields, etc.  At some point, we will want to replace them with versions
of our own bitmapped fonts and ninepatches, which we will need to "pack"
into an ATLAS file using the TexturePacker class provided with LibGDX.
